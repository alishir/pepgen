# refer to studies that say there is no difference between
# computer based and paper based IGT

previous studies have shown that there is no difference
between manual version and computerized version of
IGT(bechara2000b, bowman2005).

Several studies have shown that healthy subjects indicates
poor performance on IGT. usually IGT performance evaluate in
one of the three method follows. the simplest evaluation
method is total money won, another approach is difference
between total advantage and disadvantage selections, and the
third one is pattern of adv/dis selections across 20 block
trials.

each deck in IGT has three distinct feature. these features
are, long-term outcome, relative number of gain vs loss and
the relative number of net losses. combination of these
features is unique for each deck [horstman2012].
normalized feature weight are shown in table 1[table].
decks could be partition into advantage and disadvantage
group with respect to each feature. for example if we
consider only gain frequency feature of decks, decks A and C
are advantage and decks B and D are disadvantage. In this
study we analyse behavior of each subject in a fine
granularity manner. for each feature, we analyse choice by
choice behavior of subjects with respect to adv/dis decks.
figure 1 shows a subject behavior with respect to each three
features, selections from advantage deck corresponds to
upward movements and selections from disadvantage
decks corresponds to downward movement. the magnitude of
movement is based of feature weight that mentioned in table
1. As can be seen, most subject choices is base on gain
frequency.
