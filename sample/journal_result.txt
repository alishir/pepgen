# refer to studies that say there is no difference between
# computer based and paper based IGT

previous studies have shown that there is no difference
between manual version and computerized version of
IGT(bechara2000b, bowman2005).


Several studies have shown that healthy subjects indicates
poor performance on IGT. usually IGT performance evaluate in
one of the three method follows. the simplest evaluation
method is total money won, another approach is difference
between total advantage and disadvantage selections, and the
third one is pattern of adv/dis selections across 20 block
trials.

each deck in IGT has three distinct feature. these features
are, long-term outcome, relative number of gain vs loss and
the relative number of net losses. combination of these
features is unique for each deck [horstman2012].
normalized feature weight are shown in table 1[table].
decks could be partition into advantage and disadvantage
group with respect to each feature. for example if we
consider only gain frequency feature of decks, decks A and C
are advantage and decks B and D are disadvantage. In this
study we analyse behavior of each subject in a fine
granularity manner. for each feature, we analyse choice by
choice behavior of subjects with respect to adv/dis decks.
figure 1 shows a subject behavior with respect to each three
features, selections from advantage deck corresponds to
upward movements and selections from disadvantage
decks corresponds to downward movement. the magnitude of
movement is based of feature weight that mentioned in table
1. As can be seen, most subject choices is base on gain
frequency. 

subjects randomly assigned to each variation of IGT.
relative weight of decks features calculated  by using
linear equation systems model that described in
horstmann2012. in this model for each block of 20 trials a
linear equation system Ax = b solved, where a_ij is the
normalized feature i for deck j, and b_i is the portion of
selections from deck i, and x_i is relative weight of
feature i. subjects feature weights in each groups varies
significantly as shown in figure 3. in order to find the
source of this considerable variance we visualize subjects
behavior in each group. as mentioned before subject behavior
analysed by choice by choice selections from adv and dis
adv decks figure 1. and metric that make a deck advantage or
disadvantage is features that defined in previous
paragraph. one of the interesting pattern that exist in
subjects behavior is random walk movement pattern in
subjects selections.  as can seen in figure 5 subjects
behavior base on long-term outcome, all subjects in PPIGT
exhibit random behavior.

in order to filter out subjects that have random walk
pattern in their choices trial, we add some artificial random
subject to each group. Artificial random subject is a
subject choice pattern in 100 trial that generated randomly
by choosing each deck with equal probability at each trial.
we cluster subjects in each group to three cluster after
adding some artificial subjects to each group. by adding
artificial random subjects and clustering, subjects that
have random walk pattern in their choices join the
artificial random subjects cluster. two other clusters are
for potential subjects who learned the task and subjects who
did not learn the task.

one of the measures that indicates subjects has been learned
the task is successive selections from advantageous decks.
after running clustering algorithm on subjects choices in
each group, and filtering out the random subjects, we label
the cluster of subjects that have successive selection from
advantageous decks as learned cluster and label the other
cluster as unlearned cluster. in order to find if subject
has successive selection from advantageous decks, we
consider last 40 trials of task and fit a line to it. if the
slope of fitted line is greater than alpha, we consider that
subject has been learned the task. we notice again that
adv/dis decks depends of feature that we partition decks,
for example if we consider gain-frequency feature and
analyse a subject choice pattern, that subject may learned
the task, however if we consider an other feature the
subject may did not learn the task. in other words learning
the task depends on our view of features.
